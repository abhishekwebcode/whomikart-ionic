        <h2>WhomiKart and Website Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use a technology called “cookies” as part of a normal business procedure. Cookies are small text files that are
            created by a web server and stored on your computer when you visit a website. They don’t do anything i.e. they
            are not executable code and can only be read by (you and) the website that created them. You can view and edit
            the cookies on your computer like any other text file using a text editor (the contents are usually just strings
            of unique identifiers and date/timestamps). The website that created the cookie can read the contents when you
            are at their website.</p>
        <p>We use cookies for the following purposes: To record analytics data.</p>
        <h2>Third-party cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are widely used across the internet: you may have hundreds of cookies on your computer at any one time. Each
            browser has its own set of cookies so, if you run multiple browsers, you will have multiple sets of cookies on
            your computer.</p>
        <p>Many websites use cookies to improve your browsing experience e.g. remember your log-in details, record which items
            you have selected to purchase, or even tailor what content is displayed depending on your preferences. Cookies
            can also be used to record ‘analytics’ data i.e. which web pages you visit, whether or not you arrived at the
            web page by clicking on an advertisement or an affiliated website. Many websites find the collection of analytics
            data valuable in improving the quality and content of their web sites.</p>
        <p>In the past, cookies have had some bad press. Much was due to a general misunderstanding of what cookies are and
            how they work but some was due to justifiable privacy concerns relating to 3rd party tracking cookies. These
            cookies are used by advertising websites and track a web user across multiple sites. The good news is that all
            modern browsers allow you to easily block 3rd party cookies.</p>
        <p>All the major browsers allow you to block cookies and delete those that have already been created on your computer,
            usually within the ‘Tools’ section of the browser. These tools allow you to specify which cookies you will accept
            by type and often by specific websites using an exception list e.g. you can block all cookies and then list the
            website from which you will accept cookies. There are also wide choices of browser add-ins that you can install
            if you wish greater control over persistent cookies.</p>
        <p>We will not transfer your information without first obtaining your consent.</p>
